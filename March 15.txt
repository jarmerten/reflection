Today we spent the entire morning working on a project. We need to have the user input a number and respond with the roman numeral of it. I got it working really well and was working on having it work the opposite way until we took a short lecture in C#. It seems to translate from how java works very easily. I read a ton of lectures on C# and realized it has alot of really cool features I couldnt use in Java, or havent used at least.

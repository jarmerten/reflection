Today was a good day. I got here and was really confused on the robot project the night before but came in early and asked mike about it and I had one little things mixed up. After that we learned about arrays and tables which are a pretty easy concept to grasp. From there we started on our group projects. The games seem to all be much more complex that we are doing, so its more tricky up front and overwelming. We spend most of the day trying to set up our game so you can enter as many users as wanted to play, and we have that about figured out we believe, but we will find out in the morning.

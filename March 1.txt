We started today with learning how to check into our network and see where we were through commmand line through a .bat file. After checking the IP address I created a .bat to restart our computer and add a user commmand. I then worked on trying to get a .bat to find a certain word in a bunch of files and then change that word to another word. I got it to work by sending the files through powershell and having powershell find word and change.
	After lunch we learned css and .html for creating websites. we worked mostly on how to add text based on a regular format, including a header and body. Through css we worked on changing the colors and font. Then let go on our own, I put and image into my website and attempted to center it but I was having issues with that.

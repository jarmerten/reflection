Today we learned about Java. I already had some basic knowledge in Java so it was a good oppurtunity to learn about it again and get a real grasp for it. We got our exam scores back and i was pleasantly pleased with my results. I deffinetly know what I got wrong and now know what all those things are. Im excited to get into Java because I already understand the basic jist of it which help alot when you jump into it.

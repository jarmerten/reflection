Today we spent the day working on nim and happy numbers. Yesterday i got nim into tons of functions how adam showed us to do on dice game. I couldnt get them to work in the main so i got a little advice from mike that went a long way. His advice screwed a lightbulb in and functions made much more since to me. I was able to produce nim very efficiently compared to my last game, the dice game. I then went to happy numbers and worked on that. I have a set up for it but cant get it to run quite right right now and needs a little more work but I think i am very close to figuring it out.

Today we spent the morning working on planning our projects for next week. I was doing the lemonade game and planned it all out. I had seperated all the games functioning ideas and objects into categories, and then began to turn them in functions, ints, strings, list, and print lines. When we got back from lunch I learned that they were changing it to battleship so now i am planning the same way for battleship but hopefully better. We also got a lecture for dave where we learned about features for contstantly debugging and removing issues in our code while we right it, instead of debugging it when we know it doesnt run.

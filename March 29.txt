Today we had a bunch of lectures and information to soak in. I understand the basics of all of it and now i need to figure out how to implement it into code. I dont know where to really implement any of it in what we are doing right now, but will ask if there are any easy ways or times i should be using it. I then worked on my Garden plots tracker and figured out a bunch and got most of the main logic working.

Today we took a test all day. The test started out really bad for me because i had a hard time figuring out how to start the arrray. One i got the one line of code i was able to figure the entire thing out and connect all the dots. The only other issue was switch cases which i had one really dumb issue. I was capitalizing the case and switch instead of keeping them lowercase. Otherwise i didnt get my second program, the hr management, even close to as organized as i wanted. I got almost all the features added to it. I forgot to make it so the sups could hire new reps, i had it so only a sup could hire a new sup. Otherwise the big thing i wanted to do was organize everything alot more but i just ran out of time in the end.

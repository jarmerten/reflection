Today we find out how we did on the test. I thought I didnt alot better than i did. i knew the concepts and everything i was doing but didnt name all my variables correctly and organize my work well enough and got all my points off for that. I wouldve spent time doing that if i didnt finish the test right before the end. I had extra features in it but shouldve finished the basics and cleaned it up before going that far. We learned some basics in C# after lunch and got a project. I had a diffiuclt time starting it because of the way i was thinking we had to do it, which it doesnt make any sense and seems impossible to me, which we werent supposed to do. We also learned how to organize our project and classes in Visual Studio and worked with decompiling and adding variable to an already created project.

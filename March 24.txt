Today i finished most of my project and am just working on creating more functions and not repeating anything. I got it to determine and compare the locations of all there ships and to let the user know of invalid placement and then put the ship on the board again. I cleaned up most of my classes alot. I want to put a few more things in functions so i dont repeat the same things in multiple functions, and i was to put try catch in text so they cant quit the program by entering incorrect text.

Today we started the day off working on our website. I had issues yesterday that after I uploaded a picture it would not let me center it. I was able to figure that out after awhile and reformatting my website so it was organized better. We then went and learned about the internet and how to effectively search google. Using what I learned on searching google I went and learned how to host my own website off my computer and how to add a ton of AIs to Civ5. Coming back from lunch we reviewed for the test before taking it. The test got me. I was so concentrated on fixing the problem with my website that I didnt make the table in it until after the test. I got the basics down in the test but screwed up alot surrounding the table. After the test I worked on google searching some more and then fixed my website up and pushed it to github.

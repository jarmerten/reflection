Today we took a test which i did horrible on. I didnt know anything about doing fuctional programming. I installed irrigation system all weekend and just didnt have time to complete the projects. I started one but ran into a road block sunday night. SQL server i understand, my answers may have been off a little bit but thats because i didnt look at it over the weekend and when i was starting to reference it on monday the quiz started so what i remembered from the two days was a bit cloudy, but when i was doing it i was understanding what was going on.

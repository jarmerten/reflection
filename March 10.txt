This morning we finished our projects on the Dice Game. Our game works and we got most the bugs out of it, but there still are some. The biggest thing we need to do more of than we did (I think) is put more code in functions. Are classes were crowded and werent really sure how to move everything around because the way it was formatted with the function for as many users as wanted. After that we watched adam code which really helped me realize how much i should clean my code up and put things into functions. After lunch we started two projects. One of the projects that i began working on was called nim. I was able to make the game and put it all in functions much cleaner, but i am now having difficulties getting it running outside of those classes.

Friday was a day of ups and downs. We did a lecture on functions which I understand all of. But then we learned about classes, objects and instantiations. Those got me bad. I was so confused and tried to figure it out. I spent my entire lunch researching them and watching youtube vidoes of people teaching them. I began to understand it and still do, but it is also still confusing for me and something i couldnt without really following it and fixing many errors.

-Today started out ok with binary, but it quickly took a turn. I had confusion with hex and oct conversions but once I got a key pointer it made sense. Computer hardware went fine, Ive never built one but have plenty of experience and research about them. Not that much but a good amount. Getting into git worried me at first. I spent a few hours the past few days to figure it out but couldnt. After the lecture I caught on quickly. I would say i pretty much mastered the basic of cloning, pushing, and pulling text files.

Today we learned loops and inheritance. I understood loops before but need to make changes to my project because I did a bunch of do whiles they didnt want. Inhertiance was easy to understand also but the robot project was still hard for me. It was the way classses and objects need to be that tricked me. I could have user input to make them work but otherwise I couldnt do it. Towards the end I got the hang of it and understand it much better than I used too.
